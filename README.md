# Nathan Rahanaev's Data Analyst Portfolio
## Bio
Hello to all! My name is Nathan Rahanaev and I am an aspiring IT professional and data analyst. I have an analytical background in physics, programming and electronics.As of now, I am currently learning more about data analytics to better my knowledge of the field. I have developed a strong foundation and discipline in science through my passion for using data to divulge meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the data analytics field as an entry-level data analyst. 

During my time in the physics field and studying, I have enhanced my ability to work with complex data and detect patterns or trends. I also have experience in laboratory techniques and etiquette, data management, and statistical analysis as a result. All of these I believe will be priceless assets in my data analyst career.

In my free time, I tend to tinker with my electronics, program videogames and experiment with new data analysis tools and techniques. Whether I work on a team or independently, I relish the opportunity to grow and will do so by any means. I strive for the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

Here is my CV in[pdf](https://github.com/TheGman11/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/blob/main/Nathan%20Rahanaev%20CV.pdf).

This repository holds material that will showcase my skills, projects and track future progress in any Data Analytics, Data Science, or other programming related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
This section contains all data analytics projects with brief information regarding each one.

### Pokémon Type Analysis
**Data & Code:** 
(https://github.com/TheGman11/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/tree/Case_Study01_Pokémon-Type-Analysis)
**Objective:** 
The Objective of this analysis is to answer a series of questions in which those results can be used for potential future analysis. The questions are as followed:
Question 1: Excluding the Total Stats value, Which stats are the highest and lowest amongst all pokémon?
Question 2: What are the highest and lowest stats for each type of Pokémon?
Question 3: which types have the highest and lowest average stat values respectively?
Question 4: Which types are the most and least common?
Question 5: What types have not been discovered yet?

**Description:** 
A small and quick analysis of all 1025 Pokémon to answer a group of questions regarding their types and stats.

**Skills:** 
Data cleaning,  Data manipulation, Data analysis, Data visualization.

**Technology:** 
Google Sheets, BigQuery(SQL), Tableau.

**Results:** 
Question 1:
For all Pokémon as of generation 9, the lowest average stat is Speed at 71 and the highest average stat is Attack at 82. 

Question 2:
The following Viz entails what are the highest and lowest stats for each type of Pokémon
